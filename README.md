# test implementation and playground of TEPI(Test Engine Please Ignore)
Reinventing the wheel just to learn

We're undertaking the large task of making our own basic game engine. The different tech for graphics being explored in this engine is OpenGL with glfw, and minifb on its own.

## Testing instructions
We have yet to publish the crate so currently you have to clone this repository and use it as a local crate in your Cargo.toml

## Major graphics goals
- [x] make a screen with glfw that uses gl
- [ ] make a triangle
- [ ] make other polygons

- [x] make triangles with minifb
- [ ] make other shapes with minifb
- [ ] render a 3D model
